# Prompt: Can you describe and reason through on how you employed backtrack to solve this problem?

The backtracking approach I implemented to solve the refund item selection problem follows these key principles:

### Core Backtracking Strategy

1. **Decision Space Exploration**: The algorithm systematically explores all possible quantity decisions for each item. For each item, we consider all possible quantities we could select (0 to quantity for regular items, 0 to 10 for deposit items).
2. **State-Based Recursion**: Each recursive call to `findBestCombination` represents a state in our decision tree where:
    - `index` tracks which item we're currently considering
    - `targetCents` tracks how much of our target amount remains
3. **Pruning Invalid Paths**: I implement pruning in two ways:
    - Early termination when we exceed our target by more than the allowed overage (20 cents)
    - Skipping combinations that can't lead to valid solutions (when `result === null`)
4. **Backtracking Mechanism**: After exploring one quantity choice for the current item, we "backtrack" by trying different quantities without modifying our original state. This happens naturally through the recursion where:
    - We try a quantity
    - Make a recursive call to find the best solution for remaining items
    - Come back and try a different quantity
    - Compare all possible results to find the best one

### Memoization Enhancement

I enhanced the pure backtracking approach with memoization (dynamic programming) to avoid redundant calculations:

1. **Subproblem Identification**: Each unique combination of (item index, remaining target) represents a subproblem that might be encountered multiple times.
2. **Result Caching**: The `memo` object stores computed results for each subproblem, using `${index}_${targetCents}` as the key.
3. **Performance Improvement**: This significantly reduces the time complexity from exponential O(m^n) (where m is the maximum possible quantity and n is the number of items) to O(n * t) where t is the target amount in cents.

### Solution Evaluation

The algorithm evaluates solutions based on how close they get to the target amount:

1. **Exact Match Priority**: Solutions that exactly match the target amount are preferred
2. **Closest Match Selection**: When exact matches aren't possible, we select the solution that minimizes the absolute difference between the total and target
3. **Higher Total Preference**: When two solutions have the same absolute difference, we prefer the one with the higher total (which means it's slightly above rather than below the target)

This recursive backtracking approach with memoization efficiently explores the entire solution space while avoiding redundant calculations, which is ideal for finding the optimal solution in this constrained optimization problem.

# Prompt: I am wondering about the performance of this algorithm. This being javascript that is run in the context of a Salesforce LWC, how long do you expect this logic would need to process a situation where there are 30 distinct products available? For the purpose of efficiency, can we finish the search as soon as a fitting selection is found - meaning, it is anywhere between exact match, and 20 cent overage.

Analyzing the performance of this algorithm for 30 distinct products in a Salesforce LWC context:

With 30 distinct products, the theoretical decision space is quite large, but several factors help keep the runtime reasonable:

1. **Memoization significantly reduces complexity**: Instead of exploring all product combinations (which would be exponential), we're storing results for each (index, targetCents) combination.
2. **Practical constraints**: Regular items typically have limited quantities, and deposit items are limited to 0-10 quantities, which bounds the exploration space.
3. **Salesforce LWC environment**: Modern browsers have optimized JavaScript engines, but Salesforce's containerized environment might introduce some overhead.

For 30 products, I'd expect this algorithm to complete in under 500ms in most cases, which is acceptable for a UI operation. However, for larger catalogues or extremely high target amounts, it could take longer.

Let me optimize the algorithm to terminate early when we find a solution within the acceptable range:

refundSelectorService.js

I've optimized the algorithm to terminate as soon as it finds a solution that meets our criteria (exact match or within 20 cents over). This optimization will significantly improve performance for real-world scenarios.

Key optimizations in the updated algorithm:

1. **Early Termination**:
    - Added `isIdeal` flag for exact matches and `isAcceptable` flag for solutions within overage
    - Algorithm returns immediately when it finds an ideal or acceptable solution
    - Base cases now include detecting solutions within the acceptable overage range
2. **Fast Path Detection**:
    - Added direct checks to immediately return if current item selection creates an ideal or acceptable solution
    - Propagates success flags up the recursion tree to trigger early returns
3. **Efficient Result Propagation**:
    - When a successful path is found, the result is immediately passed up the call stack
    - This avoids unnecessary exploration of the remaining decision space

For 30 distinct products in a Salesforce LWC context, these optimizations should significantly reduce average runtime:

- **Best case**: A few milliseconds if an ideal solution is found early in the search
- **Average case**: 50-200ms as the algorithm can terminate as soon as any acceptable solution is found
- **Worst case**: 300-500ms if we need to explore many combinations before finding a solution

The optimization is particularly effective because:

1. In real-world scenarios, there are often many acceptable solutions
2. By sorting items by price descending, we increase the chances of finding acceptable solutions early
3. The early termination applies at every level of recursion, cutting off entire branches of exploration

This optimized algorithm strikes a good balance between finding an optimal solution and maintaining performance that's acceptable for a Salesforce LWC, even with larger item sets.
